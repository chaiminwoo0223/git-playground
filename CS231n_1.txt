 • Computer Vision can be applied : Physics, Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, Psychology, Biology

1.A Brief History of Computer Vision
- About 543 million years ago, Earth was mostly water
- About 540 million years ago, First animals developed eyes and the onset of vision
- Animals haf to evolve quickly in order to survive
1966, Summer Vision Project(MIT)

2.3D model
- Input Image
- Primal Sketch
- 2.5D Sketch
- 3D Model Representation

3.Generalized Cylinder(1979) & Pictorial Structure
- The basic idea is that every object is composed of simple geometric primitives

4.Machine Learning(1999-2000)
- Especially statistical machine learing techniques start to gain momentum
- momentum : SVM, Boosting graphical models
- AdaBoost Algorithm : Face Detection에 기여

5.ImageNet
- Machine Learning이 많은 것을 기여
- 트레이닝과 밴치마킹
- Image Input -> Five Output
- Convolutional Neural Networks가 많은 것을 기여

6.Computer Vision Overview
